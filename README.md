* **What are vectors?**

Vectors define the **similarity between objects** in the **vector space**.
If a pair of vectors are similar in vector space, it means that the objects they represent are similar in some way.

To obtain a vector representation of an object, you need to **apply a vectorization algorithm** to the object. Usually, this algorithm is a **neural network** that converts the object into a fixed-size vector.

* **What are the types of vectors?**


**Dense Vectors:** A regular vectors, generated by majority of the embedding models.

**Sparse Vectors:** Vectors with no fixed length, but only a few non-zero elements.
Useful for exact token match and collaborative filtering recommendations.

**MultiVectors:** Matrices of numbers with fixed length but variable height.
Usually obtained from late interaction models like ColBERT.


* **How to compare matrices of vectors in a multivectors point?**

Using the **max_sim function**, which is defined as a **sum of maximum similarities between each pair of vectors in the matrices**.


$$\text{score} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \max_{1 \le j \le M} \Bigl(\mathrm{Sim}\bigl(\mathbf{A}_i, \mathbf{B}_j\bigr)\Bigr)$$


Where N is the number of vectors in the first matrix,
M is the number of vectors in the second matrix,
and Sim is a similarity function, for example, cosine similarity.
